//! Core burrow type.
//!
//! A `Burrow` represents a participant in the Rabbit warren.  It
//! encapsulates identity management, trust management, routing,
//! federation, persistence and (optionally) user interface
//! declarations.  The burrow ties together the various layers of
//! the protocol stack into a coherent service.  This prototype
//! implementation focuses on structure and documentation rather
//! than fully fledged networking logic.  Many methods are stubs
//! meant to illustrate the intended API.
