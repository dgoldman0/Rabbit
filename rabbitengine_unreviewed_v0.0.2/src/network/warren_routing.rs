//! Warren routing and peer management.
//!
//! A warren may consist of many burrows connected in various
//! topologies.  This module manages knowledge about local peers
//! (other burrows directly connected via tunnels) and provides
//! helper functions to resolve selectors across multiple burrows.
//! It augments the generic [`Router`](crate::network::router::Router)
//! with peer details and simple gossip.  In a full
//! implementation this would also include peer health checking,
//! route selection heuristics and more.
