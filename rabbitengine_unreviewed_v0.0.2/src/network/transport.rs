//! Secure transport abstraction.
//!
//! Provides a wrapper around a TLS stream that can send and
//! receive Rabbit frames.  In this prototype the transport uses
//! `tokio-rustls` to establish TLS connections.  The
//! [`SecureTunnel`] type simplifies writing and reading frames by
//! using the [`Frame`](crate::protocol::frame::Frame) type directly.
